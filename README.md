## Introduction

Hello! My name is Luiza, and I am a self-taught developer with a passion for solving complex problems since the age of 14. My curiosity and dedication have led me to explore different areas of technology, starting in the gaming industry, where I learned to tackle performance and optimization challenges.

I value collaboration and continuous learning as pillars of my work. At [Looqbox](https://looqbox.com/), I worked as a Backend Engineer for two years, combining critical analysis and creativity to develop a Parser focused on natural language processing (NLP) using Kotlin, ANTLR, and Regex. I also implemented event-driven data pipelines with GCP PubSub, optimizing ETL processes and fostering integrations between systems.

Currently, as a Backend Software Engineer at [Caju](https://www.caju.com.br/), in the HCM business unit, where in addition to feature development, I’m directly involved in solution design, technical decision-making, and architectural definition for the features where I take the role of feature lead. I’ve also contributed to structural initiatives, such as improving the CI/CD pipeline, and participate in the oncall rotation, which has strengthened my focus on stability, operations, and system reliability.

I have a very analytical, organized, and detail-oriented approach, with a strong focus on architecture, readability, maintainability, and overall technical quality. I value well-defined processes, automation, sustainable code, and scalable solutions.
