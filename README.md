## Introduction

Hello! My name is Luiza. Iâ€™m a self-taught developer with a passion for programming since I was 14 years old. Early in my career, I worked in the gaming industry, known for its optimization and performance criteria, in a Java environment. After that, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Developer at [Looqbox](https://looqbox.com/) for 2 years, where I gained various skills related to natural language processing (NLP) using ANTLR. Additionally, I also contributed to creating event flows through messaging with PubSub (GCP) for post-processed data loading and developed a workflow responsible for processing audit messages (logs), including ETL steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and formatting. Now, I currently work at [Caju](https://www.caju.com.br/) as a Software Engineer, using Kotlin for Caju Ciclos tribe on a HR solution.

Take a look at some of my open-source work in the pinned repositories on this profile!
