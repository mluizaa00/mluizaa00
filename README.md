## Introduction

Hello! My name is Luiza, and I am a self-taught developer with a passion for solving complex problems since the age of 14. My curiosity and dedication have led me to explore different areas of technology, starting in the gaming industry, where I learned to tackle performance and optimization challenges.

I value collaboration and continuous learning as pillars of my work. At [Looqbox](https://looqbox.com/), I worked as a Backend Engineer for two years, combining critical analysis and creativity to develop a Parser focused on natural language processing (NLP) using Kotlin, ANTLR, and Regex. I also implemented event-driven data pipelines with GCP PubSub, optimizing ETL processes and fostering integrations between systems.

Currently, as a Backend Software Engineer at [Caju](https://www.caju.com.br/), I strive to align technical efficiency with strategic impact. I led the creation of solutions such as Bulk Vacation and Admission Sharing, integrating backend and frontend teams with a clear vision of architecture and documentation. I restructured CI/CD pipelines, drastically reducing execution time and enhancing the development experience.

My approach is guided by the pursuit of technical excellence and the development of scalable solutions, always focusing on creating a positive impact for the team and end users.
