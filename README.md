## Introduction

Hello! My name is Luiza. I am a self-taught developer with a passion for programming since I was 14 years old. At the beginning of my career, I worked in the gaming industry, known for its optimization and performance criteria, in a Java environment. After that, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Developer at [Looqbox](https://www.looqbox.com/) for 2 years, where I acquired various skills related to natural language processing (NLP) using ANTLR, creating event pipelines through PubSub (GCP) for a post-processed data loading stage, and creating a workflow responsible for processing audit messages (logs), with ETL stages such as data cleaning, normalization, and formatting.

Take a look at some of my open-source work in the pinned repositories on this profile!
